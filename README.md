Implemented Cases:
1.	Implemented cases where there are coupons on the cart, on the product, and buy 2 get 1 free.
2.	Handled cases for “No coupon found” and “Coupon Expired” and “Coupon can’t be applied”.
 


Unimplemented Cases:
1. There could be coupons with complex combinations, such as product-wise and cart-wise, or product-wise and buy x get y, and more.
 

 
 Assumptions:
1. There should be only one product in the "get products" list in the buy x get y scenario.
2. The expiration date of a coupon is by default 30 days from the creation of the coupon.
3. There will not be more than one coupon applicable to a product.
